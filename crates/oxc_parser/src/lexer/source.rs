/// `Source` holds the source text for the lexer, and provides APIs to read it.
///
/// It provides a cursor which allows consuming source text either as `char`s, or as bytes.
/// It replaces `std::str::Chars` iterator which performed the same function previously,
/// but was less flexible as only allowed consuming source char by char.
///
/// Consuming source text byte-by-byte is often more performant than char-by-char.
///
/// Implementation of `Source::next_char` is copied directly from `std::str::Chars::next`.
///
/// `Source` provides:
///
/// * Safe API for consuming source char-by-char (`Source::next_char`, `Source::peek_char`).
/// * Safe API for peeking next source byte (`Source::peek_byte`).
/// * Unsafe API for consuming source byte-by-byte (`Source::next_byte`).
/// * Mostly-safe API for rewinding to a previous position in source
///   (`Source::position`, `Source::set_position`).
///
/// # Composition of `Source`
///
/// * `start` is pointer to start of source text.
/// * `end` is pointer to end of source text.
/// * `ptr` is cursor for current position in source text.
///
/// # Invariants of `Source`
///
/// 1. `start` <= `end`
/// 2. The region of memory bounded between `start` and `end` must be initialized,
///    a single allocation, and contain the bytes of a valid UTF-8 string.
/// 3. `ptr` must always be >= `start` and <= `end`.
///    i.e. cursor always within bounds of source text `&str`, or 1 byte after last byte
///    of source text (positioned on EOF).
/// 4. `ptr` must always point to a UTF-8 character boundary, or EOF.
///    i.e. pointing to *1st* byte of a UTF-8 character.
///
/// These invariants are the same as `std::str::Chars`, except `Source` allows temporarily
/// breaking invariant (4) to step through source text byte-by-byte.
///
/// Invariants (1), (2) and (3) must be upheld at all times.
/// Invariant (4) can be temporarily broken, as long as caller ensures it's satisfied again.
///
/// Invariants (1) and (2) are enforced by initializing `start` and `end` from a valid `&str`,
/// and they are never modified after initialization.
///
/// Safe methods of `Source` enforce invariant (3) i.e. they do not allow reading past EOF.
/// Unsafe methods e.g. `Source::next_byte_unchecked` and `Source::peek_byte_unchecked`
/// require caller to uphold this invariant.
///
/// Invariant (4) is the most difficult to satisfy.
/// `Source::next_char` relies on source text being valid UTF-8 to provide a safe API which
/// upholds this invariant.
/// `Source::next_byte` requires very careful use as it may violate invariant (4).
/// That is fine temporarily, but caller *must* ensure the safety conditions of `Source::next_byte`
/// are satisfied, to restore this invariant before passing control back to other code.
/// It will often be preferable to instead use `Source::peek_byte`, followed by `Source::next_char`,
/// which are safe methods, and compiler will often reduce to equally efficient code.
